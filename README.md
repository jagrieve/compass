# Personal landing page

This is the codebase for my personal landing page, based on 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and 
the [Compass](https://github.com/excentris/compass) theme. It's 
currently deployed using [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), 
because I have aspirations to use [prose.io](https://prose.io/) to 
update the site on-the-go, and I'd like to use custom plugins beyond 
those supported by GitHub Pages.
